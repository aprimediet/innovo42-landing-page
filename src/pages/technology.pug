      We use a combination of best-in- class and internally developed

       The statistical models also help to overcome the issue of the various formats
       that invoices and receipts have. Instead of trying to pinpoint where data is on
       a particular document, like in traditional OCR solutions, with NLP, an understanding
       of this document is built in order to extract the relevant data.

      `After NLP has driven the relevant data classification and extraction,
      logical/business validation adds an extra layer of checks to ensure data is

      Examples of business validation include checking if a transaction date
      is not in the future or if the tax amount is the correct percentage
      of the total amount. <spacing>
      As business validations apply deterministic rules on the outcomes of stochastic models,
      the accuracy of the output is greatly increased.

      `A robust exception handling process with algorithmic intervention
      based on insights from the collected data acts as a last line of defence. <spacing>
      If the confidence levels provided by the NLP models are lower than required
      or logical/business validations fail, the invoices or receipt will be sent
      to an operator for closer attention. <spacing>
      These processes ensure clients get the most accurate data possible
      which can be used with no extra verification. <spacing>
      Also, this process ensures that issues detected are used to correct
      and configure the NLP  models and logical/business validation rules.
      This process continuously improves accuracy of the solution via iterative learning.
